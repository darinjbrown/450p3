I could not get makefile working properly.

Step 1:  compile server by executing:  g++ -std=c++17 server.cpp -o server.x -lcurses -ltermcap -lpthread

Step 2:  compile client by exectuting:  g++ -std=c++17 client.cpp -o client.x -lcurses -ltermcap -lpthread

Step 3:  Start server:  In one terminal type:  ./server.x   (this MUST be done before step 4)

Step 4:  Start client:  In a second terminal type:  ./client.x 127.0.0.1 

Step 5:  There should be a delay of several seconds while the programs connect via 2 sockets.  
      This is intentional to give 1st connection time to be established before attempting 2nd. Be patient!

Try typing in each terminal to see how input is displayed on the sender's screen and output on the receiver's.

*To end programs use ctrl d (or ctrl z on windows -- it is not clear through windows powershell testing if this functions as intended.

Backspace adjustment is implemented by checking for '\b' and decrementing the x axis counter and getting next char (instead of writing and incrementing counter)
Known issues:  
  server write thread is not functioning properly.  When attempting to write the program will fail leaving you in a terminal with curses 
    still running.  Please do initial testing by writing in client and observing in server.  If you have both terminals visible during 
    connection phases, you will see that the sockets are connecting, but there is something I was unable to solve in the reversing the
    write function in the 2nd program (server).
  Sender/Writer scrolling function works properly, but the receiver / reader scrolling function does not work.  Receiver window will 
    populate properly until it is filled.  It then appears to enter an infinite loop displaying characters in the write half of the screen
 
 
 *It is unclear to me whether this functions properly do to the way windows reads EOT / EOF tokens.  I implemented a workaround:  
    TYPE '~' TO EXIT DEFINITELY WORKS
